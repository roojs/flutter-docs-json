    "desc": "<p>A way to disambiguate a <a href=\"dart-ui\/TextPosition-class.html\">TextPosition<\/a> when its offset could match two\ndifferent locations in the rendered string.<\/p>\n<p>For example, at an offset where the rendered text wraps, there are two\nvisual positions that the offset could represent: one prior to the line\nbreak (at the end of the first line) and one after the line break (at the\nstart of the second line). A text affinity disambiguates between these two\ncases.<\/p>\n<p>This affects only line breaks caused by wrapping, not explicit newline\ncharacters. For newline characters, the position is fully specified by the\noffset alone, and there is no ambiguity.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"dart-ui\/TextAffinity-class.html\">TextAffinity<\/a> also affects bidirectional text at the interface between LTR\nand RTL text. Consider the following string, where the lowercase letters\nwill be displayed as LTR and the uppercase letters RTL: \"helloHELLO\".  When\nrendered, the string would appear visually as \"helloOLLEH\".  An offset of 5\nwould be ambiguous without a corresponding <a href=\"dart-ui\/TextAffinity-class.html\">TextAffinity<\/a>.  Looking at the\nstring in code, the offset represents the position just after the \"o\" and\njust before the \"H\".  When rendered, this offset could be either in the\nmiddle of the string to the right of the \"o\" or at the end of the string to\nthe right of the \"H\".<\/p>\n    ",
