    "desc": "<p>Algorithms to use when painting on the canvas.<\/p>\n<p>When drawing a shape or image onto a canvas, different algorithms can be\nused to blend the pixels. The different values of <a href=\"dart-ui\/BlendMode-class.html\">BlendMode<\/a> specify\ndifferent such algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>Each algorithm has two inputs, the <em>source<\/em>, which is the image being drawn,\nand the <em>destination<\/em>, which is the image into which the source image is\nbeing composited. The destination is often thought of as the <em>background<\/em>.\nThe source and destination both have four color channels, the red, green,\nblue, and alpha channels. These are typically represented as numbers in the\nrange 0.0 to 1.0. The output of the algorithm also has these same four\nchannels, with values computed from the source and destination.<\/p>\n<p>The documentation of each value below describes how the algorithm works. In\neach case, an image shows the output of blending a source image with a\ndestination image. In the images below, the destination is represented by an\nimage with horizontal lines and an opaque landscape photograph, and the\nsource is represented by an image with vertical lines (the same lines but\nrotated) and a bird clip-art image. The <a href=\"dart-ui\/BlendMode-class.html\">src<\/a> mode shows only the source\nimage, and the <a href=\"dart-ui\/BlendMode-class.html\">dst<\/a> mode shows only the destination image. In the\ndocumentation below, the transparency is illustrated by a checkerboard\npattern. The <a href=\"dart-ui\/BlendMode-class.html\">clear<\/a> mode drops both the source and destination, resulting\nin an output that is entirely transparent (illustrated by a solid\ncheckerboard pattern).<\/p>\n<p>The horizontal and vertical bars in these images show the red, green, and\nblue channels with varying opacity levels, then all three color channels\ntogether with those same varying opacity levels, then all three color\nchannels set to zero with those varying opacity levels, then two bars showing\na red\/green\/blue repeating gradient, the first with full opacity and the\nsecond with partial opacity, and finally a bar with the three color channels\nset to zero but the opacity varying in a repeating gradient.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"application-to-the-canvas-api\">Application to the <a href=\"dart-ui\/Canvas-class.html\">Canvas<\/a> API<\/h2>\n<p>When using <a href=\"dart-ui\/Canvas\/saveLayer.html\">Canvas.saveLayer<\/a> and <a href=\"dart-ui\/Canvas\/restore.html\">Canvas.restore<\/a>, the blend mode of the\n<a href=\"dart-ui\/Paint-class.html\">Paint<\/a> given to the <a href=\"dart-ui\/Canvas\/saveLayer.html\">Canvas.saveLayer<\/a> will be applied when\n<a href=\"dart-ui\/Canvas\/restore.html\">Canvas.restore<\/a> is called.
